## Project Description
This project visualizes global renewable energy adoption from 1990 to 2023 using interactive web-based charts. We're exploring how different countries have transitioned to renewable energy sources and what factors influence this transition.

## Planned Visualizations
1. Choropleth World Map - Global renewable energy share by country
2. Multi-Country Line Chart - Trend comparison over time
3. Stacked Area Chart - Energy mix by source
4. Diverging Bar Chart - Year-over-year changes
5. Scatter Plot - Economic context
6. Radial Flower Glyphs - Energy composition

## Current Progress
Working on the first two visualizations: world map and line chart.
